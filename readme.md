## Welcom to the GitHub page of Fridge Friend!

Fridge friend is THE tool that helps you keep track of produce in your fridge! It will help you have an overview of items in your fridge by recognizing using AI.

### How Does it work?

We're using the [ML5 image classification library](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/image-classifier) and a pre-trained model so you can scan various items and store them in your fridge! This is done via a raspberry pi. The scanned information gets sent to a database where the products are saved.
Our current list of prodcuts that can be scanned using our tool include:

- Cola Zero Sugar Strawberry Cream Flavour Special Edition Jumbo
- Kip Grillworst Zwagerman
- Verse Halfvolle melk 1,5% Milbona
- Drinkyoghurt mango passievrucht Optimel
- Scharrelkip Jumbo
- Bosvruchten Siroop Slimpie
- Watermeloen Aarbei Smaak Siroop Slimpie
- Halvarine Vita D'or
